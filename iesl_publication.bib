We introduce a new highly usable approach to semi-supervised learning, augmenting traditional label log-likelihood with an additional term that encourages model predictions on unlabeled data to match certain expectations. Positive results on 5 data sets versus EM, transductive SVM, entropy regularization and a graph-based method.}

We then go on to describe decision-theoretic approaches for maximizing accuracy gain with a limited budget of web queries, and demonstrate our methods on three large data sets}

  sum 		= {Discriminatively trained undirected graphical models, or conditional random fields, have had wide empirical success, and there has been increasing interest in toolkits that ease their application to complex relational data. Although there has been much historic interest in the combination of logic and probability, we argue that in this mixture 'logic' is largely a red herring. The power in relational models is in their repeated structure and tied parameters; and logic is not necessarily the best way to define these structures. Rather than using a declarative language, such as SQL or first-order logic, we advocate using an object-oriented imperative language to express various aspects of model structure, inference and learning. By combining the traditional, declarative, statistical semantics of factor graphs with imperative definitions of their construction and operation, we allow the user to mix declarative and procedural domain knowledge, and also gain significant efficiencies. We have implemented our ideas in a system we call FACTORIE, a software library for an object-oriented, strongly-typed, functional JVM language named Scala.}

GE criteria are terms in a parameter-estimation objective function that express preferences about model expectations. In certain simple cases, GE falls into the same equivalence class as moment matching, maximum likelihood and maximum entropy estimation. However, our work focusses on leveraging GE's special flexibility in three non-traditional ways: (1) GE criteria can be specified indepently of the model parameterization. In factor graphs, we break the traditional one-to-one mapping between (a) subsets of variables participating in parametered model factors and (b) subsets of variables over which the objective function's expectations are calculated. (2) Within the same objective function, multiple GE terms that are conditional expectations can be conditioned on multiple different data sets. This is useful for semi-supervised learning and transfer learning. (3) A target expectation (or more generally the expectation preference function can come from any source, including other tasks or human domain knowledge. GE is the successor to Expectation Regularization, which is described in our ICML 2007 paper.},
